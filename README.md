# Python-Program-to-Find-the-Factorial-of-a-Number

Factorial is a non-negative integer. It is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number you ask for factorial. It is denoted by an exclamation sign (!).

Example: 
n! = n* (n-1) * (n-2) *........1  
4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24   

The factorial value of 4 is 24.

In this code example, I have declared a num variable that takes an integer as an input from the user. I declared a variable factorial and assigned 1. Then, I checked if the user enters the number less than one, then it returns the factorial does not exist for a negative number. If it returns false, then we check num is equal to zero, it returns false the control transfers to the else statement and prints the factorial of a given number.
